## Problem Statement: Parallel Matrix Transposition

Exploring both implicit and explicit parallelization techniques by imple-
menting a matrix transpose operation. Benchmarking and analyzing the performance of both approaches, comparing their efficiency and scalability. Considering a matrix M of size n Ã— n, where n is a power of two.
